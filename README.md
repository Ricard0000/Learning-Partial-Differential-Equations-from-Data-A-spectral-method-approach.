# Learning-Partial-Differential-Equations-from-Data-A-spectral-method-approach.

This code is for learning PDE's of the form $u_{t}=F(u)$

where $F(u)$ is a polynomial function of $\{u,\partial_{x}u,\partial_{xx}u,\cdots\}$

The split-step method is used to to fit data $\{u(x,t_{n})\}$ to this PDE.
